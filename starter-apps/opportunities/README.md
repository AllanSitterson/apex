# Opportunities

Opportunities helps you to track your sales opportunities throughout their lifespan, while giving sales management a quick and easy tool to both see the current state of the sales pipeline and analyze past sales performance.

With Opportunities, you can define accounts, contacts, territories, products and competitors and combine these to define leads and opportunities. Opportunities includes a rich set of reports on opportunities, pipeline analysis, key accounts, projected closing dates and different snapshots of sales by rep.

All reports in Opportunities are completely customizable by users, allowing for extended analysis and charting based on these reports.
